						during the applicable Entry Period of the Promotion Period, on or around the
						dates set forth in the table above. Non-winning entries will not carry over
						into subsequent drawings.  The potential winners will be notified by email,

						minor in his/her state of residence) will be required to respond with his or
						her full contact information for prize fulfillment purposes which must be received

						returned as undeliverable, the potential winner forfeits the applicable prize. 
						Receiving a prize is contingent upon compliance with these Official Rules.  In
						the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will
						award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing from among
